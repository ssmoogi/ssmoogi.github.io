    <p class = "center-text" style = "color: black;">Hi! I'm a student and I don't know what I'm doing with my life. But I'm enjoying it :)<!---I am a highschooler interested in everything artsy, music, and tech-related. I love spending time with family and friends and learning new things. I have a passion for technology and the maker movement, and go to the Bay Area Maker Faire every year. I live and have grown up in the Bay Area and go to Santa Clara High School. I play the viola, baritone, and piano and am part of my high school orchestra and marching band. I aspire to be a Maker Youtuber or work in a field of music and tech. Most of my time is spent expanding my skills and figuring out what I want to do with my life.--> </p>
