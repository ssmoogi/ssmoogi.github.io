    <p>I got really interested in volunteering after going to the Teen Volunteer Fair in the September of 2018. Volunteering is an amazing experience, I love feeling connected to the people and community around me, and have made so many friends and met people through these experiences. If you're ever interested in finding volunteer opportunities in Santa Clara or the Bay Area, don't hesitate to <a class = "link" style = "font-size: 16px;" href="mailto:havingfunwithdiy@gmail.com">contact</a> me! I'd love to meet you and volunteer with you someday!! :)</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">12/23/2019 - 2 HRS</h1>
    <p>The community garden is located on the corner of Monroe and Stevens Creek, and is a beautiful place and a smart idea. I helped with the composting for the winter, by shovelling/raking dirt and leaves, moving tomato vines, and hosing it all down. There were so many green tomatoes on the vines, and most people would toss green tomatoes, including the garden. There was another Indian lady and her kids there as well, and she was collecting the tomatoes. There is a certain chutney you can make from them, and I ended up taking some home as well. The garden is in a really neat location as well, and I can bike there from my house through the San Thomas Aquino bike trail. I would definatly reccommend volunteering there, although it is a bit of work and you'll be covered in dirt, but I enjoyed it!</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">12/14/2019 - 28 HRS</h1>
    <p>I first met Rekha Shivapa at the kitchen during a VSNA event. Here's some background on that. VSNA (I forget what it stands for) is an community organization connecting people in the Bay Area from a particular state in India called Karnataka, in which the main language spoken is Kannada. My cousin and I were looking to help out as we were feeling a bit bored, and so ended up stirring a pot in the kitchen. I don't know if you believe in coincidences or fate, but it was fate that ended up with this blood drive happenning. Rekha had run RedCross Drives in the past from VSNA, but due to lack of community support they hadn't done one in a while. She brought the idea up to me and asked if I'd be interested in doing one, and of course the answer was yes! The goal of running this drive was to get the youth support and interest, and through that we made this event happen. It took a few months of planning and finding a place to host it, and eventually someone was able to offer up their neighborhood clubhouse. Without Rekha, this wouldn't have happened at all, and without her experience we would've been so lost. All of us worked together to contact people to be donors, and even my mom donated for her first time and for the hours after she said "I feel so good about it" or something along the lines of that. Some other highschoolers and I worked at the rest station, to make sure that the donors ate and drank something and rested for a 15 minute period before leaving. This experience was new and overall amazing.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">12/6/2019 - 4 HRS</h1>
    <p>Santa Clara Sister Cities is a community service club in my high school that sends students on exchange student trips to their partner cities around the world. Many of the community events have to do with raising funds for these trips. Because of the predicted rain, instead of selling food, we got assigned as Santa's helpers in the community center. It was honestly kind of fun, and I met a couple of junior police officers that were all in high school. My friend Alexis and I walked to the park together and met Emma, and then all proceeded to the community center to greet little kids and their parents as they left the stage after recieving a stuffed bear and meeting Santa Claus, the one and only. They also had the best hot chocolate outside, which was really nice :)</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">11/16/2019 - 3 HRS</h1>
    <p>If you are living in the Bay Area, into robotics, and have not once heard the FIRST organization, I'd think you were living in a hole, no offense. Because Cabrillo sends so many teams for FLL, Santa Clara High School hosts an First Lego League tournament every year. Because I joined the SCHS Bruin Marching Band, I didn't get much time to volunteer in the fall, but I couldn't miss this. Our last band competition was today at James Logan High, and practice started at 9, so I volunteered at the tournament from 6  am to 9 am. Sure, it might have been a stretch, but I'm glad I did it. My friend Kavi was the game announcer and Kaitlyn and Ein were basically the MC's of the event. I helped check the teams in and even saw one of my family friend's cousin's team there! (I found out later that they won some neat awards!!) FLL last year was <i>not</i> the best experience for me in my opinion, because of the people I was working with. But FTC (First Tech Challenge) is going great so far, and yes there are still conflicts but things are better than I could hope for (even though we kinda did terrible during first comp ;P).</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 20px;">FARM CAMP</h1>
    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">6/8-9-10-11-12-15-16-17-18/2019 - 46 HRS</h1>
    <p>Farm Camp was a valuable experience I had this summer. I didn’t know up until this year, but the Full Circle Farm/SCUSD Farm has its own Food and Farm Camp every summer. The campers get to harvest their own fruits and veggies and make their own delicious snack and lunch with them. This was yet another opportunity that Kelsey offered to me, and I also got to meet Mint, who is one of the nicest people ever, and she runs the came every year. Volunteering at this camp made this summer so rewarding. The other volunteers and I helped the counselors keep track of the campers and keep them engaged. We also helped the kids chop up their fruits and veggies and did a lot of the cooking. The first week I volunteered, I was there from 7:30-1:30. The kids were 5-7 years old and loved to help out, though that week we did most of the cooking for them since they were so young. They were all so adorable! We helped they harvest seasonal fruits and veggies, and wash and eat them. They also did crafts and played games which we joined in on. The next week though, I was there from 7:30-3:30. The kids were 8-10 years old and could handle a lot by themselves. I have never met so many kids who liked washing dishes. I enjoyed spending time with the other volunteers and the campers. I met a couple of high school students and two of them were from SCHS, Quinten and Jessica. We talked a lot about K-Pop and music in school, and hobbies/interests. The campers were fun to hang out with and were filled with curiosity and enthusiasm that becomes harder to come by as you grow older! I learned to take initiative and responsibility through these two weeks. I love to cook (but am not great at it) and this gave me the opportunity to improve my skills and get feedback from other too.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">6/19-26-28/2019 - 15 HRS</h1>
    <p>This volunteer opportunity was unique and a great experience. I volunteered at Wilcox a couple of days to help tutor incoming high school students who came from other countries and did not speak English fluently. I volunteered here in between other things I was doing this summer, for a total of 3 days and 5 hours a day. I found out about this through another student in the SLI program. As a tutor, I helped correct grammar and English and help them out if they were stuck. Throughout the weeks they were working on a Rosetta Stone course and the other tutor and I helped them out if they get stuck on a question. Along with that, the students were working on a WeVideo project and we were able to help out with the video editing and pronunciation in their voice recordings. I enjoyed spending time with a group of people that I wouldn’t normally communicate with because of a language barrier. Many of them had come from Central America and Mexico, but some had come from Vietnam, India, and other countries. It definately would have helped to have some Spanish background, as it was tough to communicate effectively, but after that experience I think I am better at putting complex thoughts in simpler terms, which will help so, so much for tutoring and being able to explain things in the future. I had a great time helping them improve their English and getting to know them.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">6/20/2019 - 7 HRS</h1>
    <p>I first volunteered at the district Farm on June 20th at the farm dinner. This dinner helped raise funds for the farm and connect people in the district. Santa Clara Unified is currently trying to get more produce from the farm into school cafeterias, and I think that that is awesome! Volunteering on the farm is always a blast because it is such a soothing environment and atmosphere. The people I meet are always so outgoing and dedicated to what they do. Kelsey Perusse plans the menus for the cafeterias in the district and is a great chef as well, and she and other chefs in the district cooked the food that we had the honor to serve. It was through her that I got the opportunity to volunteer here! Helping out at the dinner was kind of a wierd experience, since I didn't know that there was a certain etiquette to serving food, and was constantly checking to make sure I didn't mess up. Before the event we helped set up the tables and decorations and after we helped take everything down. Along the way we got to try some of the food as well, and they wear absolutely delicious! There were so many Santa Clara High students volunteering, all who were members of Santa Clara High’s agricultural club or track team who were volunteering that day. Hopefully I'll get to see them again when school starts!</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">6/17-19-20/2019 - 9 HRS</h1>
    <p>For a week during the summer, I volunteered to help clean and organize the FabLab. I did this for a total of 3 days, the morning each day (3 hours). I mainly did various tasks to help get the lab ready for the next year and to finish up work from the previous year. Things I did: I helped clean the prototype room by sorting out the PVC pipes and organizing other items and I helped sort out some of the old FTC items with the sophomores. I also filed performance reviews, logged and filed Junior/Senior hours, and labeled the incoming class’s folders. I enjoyed meeting the sophomores and Ms. Toyama in the high school lab. The highschoolers were all really nice and seemed enthusiastic the next year and helping out. In the future if I ever need to file papers or enter information into Google Sheets, I can say I have had experience and can do things quickly. Spending time at the lab before school starts helped me get familiar with the school campus and the FabLab. I also got a chance to see how the Juniors filled their 300+ hours with college visits, volunteering, internships, and enrichment events while entering hours into Google Sheets so it would be easier for Ms. Hayes to enter it into Volgistics later. It was neat to see which colleges the students liked and what they looked for in each and what they wanted to be in the future.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">4/26/2019 - 4 HRS</h1>
    <p>This was yet another opportunity I found out about through the volunteer fair in September, but this time I got some of my friends from Peterson to volunteer with me! Here we were helping to run the raffle booth as a fundraiser for the American Cancer Foundation, the organizaton that runs relays for the funding of cancer research all over the country. Essentially, we were selling and giving out raffle tickets for people to enter to win a certain prize. We even bought a few raffle tickets ourselves, talked to people about their experiences, and participated in activities there. It was great to see the community of families that had lost people to cancer and cancer survivors together. There were talks and music, along with the luminara ceremony at the end, which I wish I could have stayed and watched. I really loved helping out at this event and spending time with my friends, and would definately do it again next year.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">4/22/2019 - 3 HRS</h1>
    <p>There's always been a small farm behind my previous middle school, Peterson. Formerly called the Full Circle Farm, but later bought by the school district, it is now called the SCUSD Farm. From my 6th grade years, we used to walk by and say high to the goats (that were relocated after ownerships switched). Our class also went there twice a week, but I never went as I was taking Orchestra instead. But I saw this opportunity through the district PeachJar flyers and decided to try it out. After taking the bus back from Cabrillo, which stops at all the middle schools in the district before heading to Peterson, I walked to the farm. Once there I met Kelsey's mom (in image at top) and Kelsey herself. She is the dietrician for the cafeterias in the district. I helped little kids make lavender pouches and write goals that they have for improving the environment, so they can remind theirselves about helping the environment when they smell the lavender. I loved volunteering at the farm, and they had amazing basil lemonade as well! It was a very well planned out event, and I enjoyed it very much.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">3/20/2019 - 1.5 HRS</h1>
    <p>The multicultural fair at Cabrillo was one of my favorite memories of my 8th grade year. It took place in the school cafeteria on a weekday afternoon. I helped out at the India booth, as both my parents grew up and were born in India, bringing their cultures with them to the US where I was raised. A few others and I helped with giving people hena tatoos, as it is commonly done in India, especially for weddings. It was awesome to see people from all different cultures together and sharing what makes their culture so unique. There was so many types of food and sweets and smells, and especially a lot of people. I could use some practice with my hena skills though, they weren't that great.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">1/30/2019 - 3.5 HRS</h1>
    <p>To be part of 49ers SLI, you have to go through a two-step application process, the second part being the interview. I didn't get selected through the interview for my 7th grade year, but I did for my 8th grade. In the end, I think it worked out better for me,but it would have been nice to be part of the program for all 6 years. Anyway, each year they have transfer applications to fill in spots of students that left the previous year, and there are only 60 spots total per cohort. I particularly felt more connected to the people I met here, because I got to share my experiences and how things had gone for me being in Peterson Middle for two years and transfering into the the second year of my cohort in the program. I really hope that in the future I get to meet some of the people I talked to. Personally, I feel like the students that get in through tranferring are really the nicest people from what I've seen. They persevere and show passion for what they do, especially if they didn't get in in their first year when they were competing for a spot with 300 other kids.</p>

    <h1 class = "title" style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">11/16/2018 - 5 HRS</h1>
    <p>This is probably my favorite volunteer event to date. SVEF, Silicon Valley Education Foundation, funds and supports 49ers SLI, a STEM focused program in the Santa Clara Unified School District. This dinner was hosted at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, and the venue was <i>incredible</i>. I definately think the perks from this were greater than the work put in. Sometimes I wish that I was truely earning the hours I was volunteering, but for this event I honestly didn't mind. It was so much fun, and I am so grateful for this volunteer opportunity. Before the main event, a freshman at Santa Clara High and I greeted people entering the VIP lounge. I can't believe some of the people I got to meet, the CEO of Adobe, Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo and Co-Founder of a local AI start-up Lumi Labs, and Kari Hall, the meteorologist at NBC who was the MC for the event. Later during the auction/donation part after the food, we held up pom-poms for the auctioneers. The food though, I don't think I deserved --- it was that good. I hope someday I'll be rich enough to eat more meals like that!</p>

    <p>At the Youth Activity Center every year, they have a Halloween Party. I didn't know about this until I transferred to Cabrillo Middle in 8th grade and went to the Teen Center afterschool almost every day. And I've lived in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale this whole time! Anyway, since I already had plans for Halloween to go trick-or-treating with one of my best friends since elementary, Sarah, I signed up for the set up shift. It was a lot of decorating and heavy-lifting which is fine by my standards. I wish I had gotten to talk to more people and spent more time, but overall it went well.</p>

    <p>SSCF is a cancer fighting organization raising money and spreading awareness about cancer in India and the U.S. They had a youth program that I am part of, and have multiple events every year. This one was in San Ramon at a middle school. Dandia is a dance night kind of thing, I don't really know how to explain it. Every year my mom and I go, and they play loud Bollywood music and you dance until pretty late. At this event I was in charge of managing the table and talking to parents and people about SSCF, but later as many people weren't by the table I switched over to help serve and sell food. I met some really cool people, and had some fun as well.</p>

    <p>I found out about this event through the Stevens Creek Lexus annual Teen Volunteer Fair! (I'd definately say to check this out if you're looking for one time, weekly, or monthly volunteer opportunities. It's held in September!) The Canary Foundation is a research foundation dedicated to early cancer detection research in Palo Alto, based in Stanford. They were hosting a 5k/10k bike/walk/run to raise funds at Varian Medical Foundation (a company developing proton-therapy cancer devices). This was the last year they decided to host their relay event I think, but it was a total blast! My mom decided to volunteer with me since I was at this event all alone (now we have t-shirts from it ;P). We stood by the finish line for the afternoon ringing yellow cow bells when people came through the exit. It did kind of become monotonous, but I loved meeting people and see how many people supported this cause. We still have the cowbells from it!</p>

    <p>At this event I helped parents find where their kids' classrooms are during Back to School Night! I helped guide parents around and find the classes they needed to go to. I got to volunteer at this event through my 8th grade Leadership class. It was a lot of fun, hanging out with my friends and being able to assist parents. I even saw my music teacher there, since her two sons went there!</p>
