    <p>As you might already know, I am <i>very</i> into the whole Maker Movement, and I love to diy things. I enjoy coding and software-related projects, game development, art, music, electronics, and building things. All of these were made at home or at my school FabLab. Some of my favorite makers/YouTubers are Evan and Katelyn, Mark Rober, Adam Savage, Bob from I Like to Make Stuff, and Simone Giertz. Check them out on YouTube, and check out my Instructables account, <a class = "link" target="_blank" href = "https://www.instructables.com/member/ssmoogi/" style = "font-size: 16px;">@ssmoogi</a>, where I post detailed instructions on some of my favorite projects. Enjoy :)</p>

I had some free time on my hands, and thought, "Why not decorate these, they look kinda plain." And so I did. I even posted an Instructable on this one, back in the days when I had free time over the summer XD. Hope you try it out!</br></br><a class = "link2" href = "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Notebook-Cover-Decor/">Make This Project!</a>

Where other kids were watching Jessie, or Spongebob, this was my jam. The past summer I rewatched both shows, and fell in love with it once again. I'd always wanted to try out cosplay, and I'd had failed plans in the past of becoming my all time favorite avatar in the show, so this year I went for it! Can you see the resemblence?

Handmade cards and gifts are one of my favorite things in the world, and this project, made for my friend Kavi, is essentially a jar full of M&Ms. Idea given to me by another friend, Kaitlyn, making a label for the jar titled "Chill Pills" was what I thought to be a <strong>g e n i u s</strong> idea. I think she liked them, but I honestly don't know. I would have definately kept this gift on my desk though!

On there, you might see some shirts from my mom's work (Cisco)and my elementary school. This project is <i>extremely</I> simple, and through this is how I taught myself to use a sewing machine. It is 4 shirts wide and 5 shirts long, and very, very cozy.

          <p class = "project-info">I am so, so, SO in love with Marie Lu's books. They are all absolutely incredible! One of my number one favorites is <i>Warcross</i>. This jacket is painted with acrylic paint mixed with fabric medium. The back features part of a quote by the main character, Emika Chen, "Every locked door has a key, every problem has a solution." One sleeve shows the tatoo that Emika has in the novel, and the other arm states the author's name and the name of the company that created the game Warcross, Henka Games. This book is a definately recommended read, and this project was so much fun to make as well!
